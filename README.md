Integrated Data Engineering and Balanced LSTM Modeling for Leak-Free Hypoglycemia Prediction During Ramadan
Abstract
Objective. To develop a leak‑free pipeline that integrates clinical, CGM, and wearable data to predict hourly hypoglycemia (≤70 mg/dL) during Ramadan and Shawwal, and to benchmark recurrent models under class imbalance.

Methods. We harmonized participant identifiers across seven clinical visits and intraday streams, programmatically tagged Ramadan/Shawwal windows, and ran a percent‑aware quality audit. From CGM we derived hourly statistics (min, max, mean, SD) and a 3‑component CGM PCA; from Huawei wearables we aggregated steps, energy, heart rate, SpO₂, and sleep, then projected to a 3‑component lifestyle PCA. The outcome label per hour was 1 if any CGM ≤70 mg/dL (sensitivity analyses consider ≤54 mg/dL and hypo‑minutes). To avoid information leakage, patients (not samples) were split before any scaling/PCA; scalers and PCA were fit on train patients and applied unchanged to test patients. Sequences used 24‑hour lookbacks with feature triplets [cgm_mean, cgm_std, pc1_activity_energy]. We trained five recurrent models (LSTM‑100/50/25‑L1/25‑L2, BiLSTM) with focal loss (γ=2, α=0.25), and compared six imbalance strategies (none, oversample, undersample, SMOTE, SMOTE+ENN, SMOTE+Tomek). Thresholds were tuned in 0.40–0.60 to maximize PR‑F1.

Results. The engineering pipeline yielded ≈19 k hourly windows; train/test sequences were (15 173, 24, 3) and (3 722, 24, 3), respectively. CGM PCA’s first three components explained ≈99% of variance; lifestyle PCA (activity/energy, physiology, sleep/rest) explained ≈64%. On the original (imbalanced) test, the best baseline (LSTM‑50) achieved weighted F1=0.9626, ROC‑AUC=0.886, accuracy=96.6%. On a balanced test, the leaders were BiLSTM/undersample and LSTM‑100/undersample with weighted F1≈0.820, ROC‑AUC≈0.89, PR‑AUC≈0.90; optimal decision thresholds concentrated near 0.41±0.01. Training was stable; each model converged within ≈60–80 s on a Tesla P100.

Conclusion. Leak‑free, patient‑split LSTM/BiLSTM models trained with focal loss and moderate undersampling provide robust, interpretable hour‑ahead hypoglycemia risk during fasting. The pipeline generalizes across Ramadan/Shawwal and complements a broader all‑day risk framework grounded in CGM + behavior signals and rigorous leakage prevention. Hourly construction, mg/dL conversion, and leakage‑avoidance conventions follow the study’s predefined methodology.
